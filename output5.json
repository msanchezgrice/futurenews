The development, verified by inspectors at the Fordow facility before their expulsion last week, represents the culmination of escalating tensions that began when Tehran withdrew from monitoring agreements in 2026.\n\nThe United States deployed two carrier strike groups to the Persian Gulf and conducted joint military exercises with Israel and Saudi Arabia, while President Harris warned that \"all options remain on the table\" to prevent Iran from assembling a nuclear weapon. Oil markets reacted sharply to the crisis, with Brent crude surging to $145 per barrel on fears of supply disruptions. Israel conducted airstrikes on the Natanz enrichment facility, destroying centrifuge halls but failing to halt Iran's program, according to intelligence assessments.\n\nThe UN Security Council convened an emergency session, though prospects for unified action appear dim given Russian and Chinese opposition to additional sanctions. European leaders called for renewed negotiations, but Iranian officials rejected talks unless the U.S. lifts sanctions imposed over the past five years. Military analysts estimate Iran could assemble a crude nuclear device within three to six months if it chooses to weaponize its enriched uranium stockpile.\n\nThe crisis has sent shockwaves through global energy markets and raised fears of a broader Middle East conflict. Gulf states have activated air defense systems and begun evacuating non-essential personnel from oil facilities. Insurance premiums for tankers transiting the Strait of Hormuz have quadrupled in the past week, and several major shipping companies have suspended operations in the region pending security guarantees.","confidence":62},{"id":"ft-2026-02-19-y5-business-dei-is-dead-equality-isn-t-experts-chart-path-forward-amid-markets","section":"Business","title":"Corporate Equality Programs Rebrand as 'Merit and Inclusion' Amid Political Pressure","dek":"Major companies have restructured diversity initiatives under new frameworks emphasizing skills-based hiring and universal access, responding to regulatory changes and cultural shifts since 2026.","image":"","meta":"Business • February 19, 2031","prompt":"Editorial photo illustration of: ‘DEI is dead, equality isn’t’: experts chart path forward amid Trump’s culture war.

The San Francisco-based firm, which raised $30 billion at a $380 billion valuation in early 2026, has seen its enterprise AI revenue grow at a compound annual rate of 47 percent, driven by widespread adoption of its Claude platform across financial services, healthcare, and government sectors.\n\nThe broader AI industry has transformed the technology landscape over the past five years, with custom AI chips now accounting for 40 percent of all data center compute capacity, up from less than 15 percent in 2026. Energy consumption by AI infrastructure has tripled, prompting a wave of investment in nuclear and renewable power projects dedicated to serving hyperscale data centers. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon collectively spent $340 billion on AI infrastructure in 2030 alone.\n\nEnterprise spending on AI tools and services grew 35 percent annually between 2026 and 2030, with companies reporting productivity gains of 20 to 40 percent in knowledge work tasks. The shift has displaced an estimated 12 million jobs in customer service, data entry, and routine analysis roles, while creating 8 million new positions in AI training, oversight, and integration. Labor economists project the net employment impact will turn positive by 2033 as new industries emerge around AI-augmented services.\n\nAnthropic's ascent reflects the winner-take-most dynamics of the foundation model market, where the top five players now control 78 percent of enterprise AI spending. The company's success in building reliable, interpretable models has made it the preferred vendor for regulated industries, with 60 percent of Fortune 500 financial institutions now running Claude-based systems for compliance, risk assessment, and customer interaction.","confidence":78},{"id":"ft-2026-02-19-y5-ai-ai-agents-markets","section":"AI","title":"2031: Agents manage complex multi-week projects autonomously","dek":"By February 19, 2031, agents manage complex multi-week projects autonomously.
